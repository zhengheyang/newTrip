                    The New York Times Travel section recently published an article about the often-overlooked Barcelona architect (and former teacher of Gaudí), Lluís Domènech i Montaner. I managed to miss his buildings on my first trip to Barcelona, and don’t plan to make that mistake again! You can follow his work using the Barcelona Modernisme Route.

It's nowhere near as famous as another example in Barcelona, the building that now houses the CaixaForum, or as large as some of the other factory buildings built in the same period, but curious — and close-by! — nevertheless.
